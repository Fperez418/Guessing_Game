"""
Guessing Game. The program will do the following:
1. Generate random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9)
2. Prompt user for a guess input
3. Let the user know if they are too high or too low
4. Let the user guess until they've figured it out - print number of guesses
5. Ask user to start new game or exit
